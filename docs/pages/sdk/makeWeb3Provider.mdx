## Returns 
A new `CoinbaseWalletProvider` instance, which is an [Ethereum Javascript provider](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) provider.

## Parameters 

### options (optional)
- Type: `'all' | 'smartWalletOnly' | 'eoaOnly'`

Determines which connection options users will see. Defaults to `all`. 


#### `all`
Users will see Smart Wallet and Wallet Link connection options. 

:::info
If a user is using a browser with Coinbase Wallet Extension installed, they will be taken straight to the 
Coinbase Wallet Extension and not see any choice. 
:::

#### `smartWalletOnly`
With this option, users will only see an option to create a Smart Wallet or sign into their Smart Wallet. 

:::warning
If a user is using a browser with Coinbase Wallet Extension installed, they will be taken straight to the 
extension *even if* this option is set. If users want to use Smart Wallet on that broswer, they will need
to disable the Coinbase Wallet Extension temporarily. See FAQ on "How this works with the rest of Coinbase Wallet" TODO. 
:::

#### `eoaOnly`
Users will only see Wallet Link connection option. If the user is on mobile, they will be taken directly 
to the Coinbase Wallet app. If the user is using a browser with Coinbase Wallet Extension, they will be taken 
directly to the Extension.
