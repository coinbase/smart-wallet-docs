# Create a React Native App

<Callout type="info">
  This doc is updated for Mobile Wallet Protocol Client `v0.1.0`
</Callout>

This guide will walk you through adding support for Smart Wallet into a React Native app by integrating the [Mobile Wallet Protocol Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mobile-wallet-protocol/client).

<Callout type="success">
  **Tips**: If you need a template or scaffold to start with, you can check out
  the [Smart Wallet Expo
  Example](https://github.com/MobileWalletProtocol/smart-wallet-expo-example).
</Callout>

::::steps

## Prerequisites

### Deeplink handling

Your app needs to be correctly configured to handle [Universal Links (iOS)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content) and [App Links (Android)](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links).
At runtime, a link like `https://your-app.example.com/mobile-wallet-protocol` should be able to open up your app for smart wallet to send responses back.

Follow this [Expo Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/deep-linking/) for detailed instructions on setting up deeplinks in the Expo environment, this is a required setup for smart wallet to work.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please make sure you hosted `apple-app-site-association` file and
  `assetlinks.json` file under your domain's `/.well-known/` path.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  When instantiating the SDK, `appDeeplinkUrl` is required to establish your
  app's identity. Use 'https://' links for production. If a custom scheme
  `myapp://` is provided, users will see a banner warning about the insecure
  connection.
</Callout>

### Install peer dependencies

The Mobile Wallet Protocol Client library requires the [Expo WebBrowser](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/webbrowser/) and [Async Storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/install) packages to be installed.
Follow the instructions on the respective pages for any additional setup.

:::code-group

```zsh [npm]
npm i expo expo-web-browser @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

```zsh [yarn]
yarn add expo expo-web-browser @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

:::

### Polyfills

Mobile Wallet Protocol Client requires `crypto.randomUUID`, `crypto.getRandomValues`, and `URL` to be polyfilled globally since they are not available in the React Native environment.

Below is an example of how to polyfill these functions in your app using the [expo-crypto](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/crypto/) and [expo-standard-web-crypto](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-standard-web-crypto/) packages.

:::code-group

```zsh [npm]
npm i expo-crypto expo-standard-web-crypto react-native-url-polyfill
```

```zsh [yarn]
yarn add expo-crypto expo-standard-web-crypto react-native-url-polyfill
```

:::

:::code-group

```js [polyfills.js]
import "react-native-url-polyfill/auto";
import { polyfillWebCrypto } from "expo-standard-web-crypto";
import { randomUUID } from "expo-crypto";

polyfillWebCrypto();
crypto.randomUUID = randomUUID;
```

```tsx [App.tsx]
import "./polyfills"; // import before @mobile-wallet-protocol/client

import { CoinbaseWalletSDK } from "@mobile-wallet-protocol/client";

/// ...
```

:::

## Setup

### Install Mobile Wallet Protocol Client

Add the latest version of Mobile Wallet Protocol Client to your project.

:::code-group

```zsh [npm]
npm i @mobile-wallet-protocol/client@latest
```

```zsh [yarn]
yarn add @mobile-wallet-protocol/client@latest
```

:::

### Configuration

Next, set up your app to pass in deeplinks coming from Smart Wallet to Mobile Wallet Protocol Client so that it can handle responses to the requests you make.
In your app, this might look something like the following.

Below is an example of how to set up deeplink handling in your app using the [Expo Linking module](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/linking/).

<Callout type="warning">
  If you are using a different library, you will need to adapt the code
  accordingly.
</Callout>

```tsx [App.tsx]
import { handleResponse } from "@mobile-wallet-protocol/client";
import * as Linking from "expo-linking";

// ...

useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = Linking.addEventListener("url", ({ url }) => {
    const handled = handleResponse(url);
    if (!handled) {
      // handle other deeplinks
    }
  });

  return () => subscription.remove();
}, []);
```

## Usage

Mobile Wallet Protocol Client provides 2 interfaces for mobile app to interact with the Smart Wallet, an EIP-1193 compliant provider interface and a wagmi connector.

<Callout type="success">
  If your app is using wallet aggregator, go straight to **Option 2: Wagmi
  Connector** for 1-line integration. :)
</Callout>

### Option 1: EIP-1193 Provider

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that we are iterating on the Mobile Wallet Protocol Client and the API
  may change.
</Callout>

Create a new `EIP1193Provider` instance, which is EIP-1193 compliant.

The `appDeeplinkUrl` is required and should match the deeplink URL you set up earlier.

<Callout type="success">
  The `appCustomScheme` config option can be used to remove the Done screen
  after signing.
</Callout>

```tsx [App.tsx]
import { EIP1193Provider } from "@mobile-wallet-protocol/client";

// Step 1. Initialize provider with your dapp's metadata and target wallet
const metadata = {
  appDeeplinkUrl: "https://your-app.example.com", // required to establish your app's identity, use 'https://' link for production
  appCustomScheme: "myapp://", // optional, used to remove the Done screen after signing
  appName: "My App Name",
  appChainIds: [8453],
  appLogoUrl: "https://example.com/logo.png",
};
const provider = new EIP1193Provider({
  metadata,
  wallet: Wallets.CoinbaseSmartWallet,
});

// ...

// 2. Use the provider
const addresses = await provider.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
const signedData = await provider.request({
  method: "personal_sign",
  params: ["0x48656c6c6f20776f726c6421", addresses[0]],
});
```

### Option 2: Wagmi Connector

Add the latest verion of Mobile Wallet Protocol wagmi-connectors to your project.

:::code-group

```zsh [npm]
npm i @mobile-wallet-protocol/wagmi-connectors@latest
```

```zsh [yarn]
yarn add @mobile-wallet-protocol/wagmi-connectors@latest
```

:::

Simply import the `createConnectorFromWallet` function and pass in the wallet you want to use to wagmi config.

<Callout type="success">
  The `appCustomScheme` config option can be used to remove the Done screen
  after signing.
</Callout>

```ts [config.ts]
import {
  createConnectorFromWallet,
  Wallets,
} from "@mobile-wallet-protocol/wagmi-connectors";

const metadata = {
  appDeeplinkUrl: "https://your-app.example.com", // required to establish your app's identity, use 'https://' link for production
  appCustomScheme: "myapp://", // optional, used to remove the Done screen after signing
  appName: "My App Name",
  appChainIds: [8453],
  appLogoUrl: "https://example.com/logo.png",
};

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [base],
  connectors: [
    createConnectorFromWallet({
      metadata,
      wallet: Wallets.CoinbaseSmartWallet,
    }),
  ],
  transports: {
    [base.id]: http(),
  },
});
```

Then you can use wagmi's react interface to interact with the Smart Wallet.

```tsx [App.tsx]
import { useConnect } from "wagmi";

// ...

const { connect, connectors } = useConnect();

return (
  <Button
    title={"Connect"}
    onPress={() => {
      connect({ connector: connectors[0] });
    }}
  />
);
```
