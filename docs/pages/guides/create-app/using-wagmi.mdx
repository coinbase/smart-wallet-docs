# Getting Started with Wagmi Template
This guide covers creating a new Wagmi template project that uses Smart Wallet. 
We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) for Node package manager 
as these have superior `resolutions` support. 
:::info
Note, the instructions in this guide are only needed while Smart Wallet is in beta.
After mainnet launch, Wagmi and others will have full support and the template will work
as is. 
:::

### 1. Run the following command and proceed through the prompts. 

:::code-group
 
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create wagmi
```
 
```bash [bun]
bun create wagmi
```
:::


### 3. Install packages and run dev. 

:::code-group
 
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install && pnpm run dev
```
 
```bash [bun]
bun install && bun run dev
```
:::

### 4. Update the Wagmi config and coinbaseWallet connector to use baseSepolia
`src/wagmi.ts` should look something like this:

   ```ts twoslash
   import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi';
   import { baseSepolia } from 'wagmi/chains';
   import { coinbaseWallet } from 'wagmi/connectors';

   export const config = createConfig({
     chains: [baseSepolia],
     connectors: [
       coinbaseWallet({ appName: 'Create Wagmi' }),
     ],
     transports: {
       [baseSepolia.id]: http(),
     },
   });

   declare module 'wagmi' {
     interface Register {
       config: typeof config;
     }
   }
   ```

### 5. Visit your site locally, click the "Coinbase Wallet" button, and choose "Create a Smart Wallet." 

Note, if you are using a browser with Coinbase Wallet Extension enabled, 
that will be the default connection method and you will not see a screen to choose Smart Wallet. 
Temporarily disable the Extension to connect with Smart Wallet.


### 6. Keep building
