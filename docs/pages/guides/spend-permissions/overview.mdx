# Spend Permissions

Spend Permissions enable apps/third-party spenders to spend native tokens and ERC-20 tokens on behalf of users in a recurring way.  
This unlocks use cases that would otherwise be prohibited by the burden of requiring real-time signatures from users, such as frequent in-game spending,
subscription payments, auto-renewals, asynchronous spends such as automated or event-based trading, and more. Designed to integrate with Coinbase Smart Wallet V1,
a smart wallet adds the single `SpendPermissionManager` contract as an owner of their account, and can then use this gatekeeper to authorize third-party spenders
to spend from their account within their specified parameters. In addition to the spender, spend permissions specify the start and end times that bound a
permissionâ€™s validity, as well as an allowance and a recurring period duration, allowing the spender to spend up to this allowance per-period. Users can revoke
existing permissions at any time. While authorized spending of ERC-20s has long been supported by allowance and permit mechanisms in token standards like ERC-20,
the abstract flexibility provided by smart contract wallets enables unlimited creativity around the programmability of these wallets and other logic they may integrate with.
Spend permissions are an early example of functionality that can be achieved within this new paradigm.

## What is a spendpermission / what is it parameterized by?

## How to approve? + batching

## How to revoke?

## Cycle accounting

--> Known accounting issue with the non-reverting ERC20s

## ERC6492 and general notes on SCW signature validation (link to other sig validation docs?)

Maybe leave this out entirely unless we find we're getting a lot of questions about it
