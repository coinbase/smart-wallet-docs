# Spend Permissions

Spend Permissions enable third-party signers to spend assets (native and ERC-20 tokens) from user wallets. 
This unlocks the following use cases: // TODO make note about reduced signing
- frequent in-game spending
- subscription payments
- auto-renewals
- automated or event-based trading
- micropayment streaming

Differences between Spend Permissions and ERC-20 permits:
- Spend Permissions **supports all ERC-20 assets**, whereas permits only support ERC-20s that implement the permit standard  
- Spend Permissions **enable spending native tokens**  
- Spend Permissions offers granular **controls for recurrence**  
- The logic that controls asset movements is **implemented in the user's wallet**, not the asset contract  


## The `SpendPermission` details
A spend permission is defined by the following parameters

```solidity
struct SpendPermission {
    address account;
    address spender;
    address token;
    uint160 allowance;
    uint48 period;
    uint48 start;
    uint48 end;
    uint256 salt;
    bytes extraData;
}
```


## Approving

Spend permissions can be approved in two ways. the user can sign the hash
of a spend permission and anyone can submit that signature and the details of the spend permission to
`approveWithSignature` (or `approveBatchWithSignature` in the case of a batch signature) to authorize
the approval. 


## Revoking

Users can revoke permissions at any time by calling `SpendPermissionManager.revoke`, which can also be batched via 
`CoinbaseSmartWallet.executeBatch`. Once a spend permission has been revoked, it can never be re-approved. 

If the user wants to re-authorize the spend permission, the spender will need to generate a new spend permission 
that has a unique hash from the original spend permission. If the details of the new spend permission are identical
to the revoked permission, the `salt` field of the permission should be used to generate a unique has.

## Cycle accounting

Spend permissions allow an app to request to spend user assets on a recurring basis (e.g. 10 USDC / month). 
As apps spend user assets, the `SpendPermissionManager` contract tracks cumulative spend and enforces the allowance for the 
current period. Once enough time passes to enter the next period, the allowance usage is reset to zero and 
the app can keep spending up to the same allowance.

This behavior is parameterized by the following properties of a spend permission:

`start`: time this permission is valid starting at (unix time, seconds)  
`end`: time this permission is valid until (unix time, seconds)  
`period`: duration of a recurring interval that resets the spender's allowance (seconds)  
`allowance`: amount of tokens spendable per period

Note that spend permissions can be used for one-time allowances, either time-bounded or indefinite, by setting
a period durantion that spans the entire range between start and end.

## Additional documentation
Contract sourcecode, diagrams, and additional documentation can be found in the open-source [contracts repository](https://github.com/coinbase/spend-permissions).

## Known issues
ERC20s w non-reverting transfers will lead to inconsistent spend state  
Duplicate spend permissions can be approved (and regardless of revocation status)
Unlimited batch size

## Misc
ERC6492 Signatures are supported 

## Appendix:

Designed to integrate with Coinbase Smart Wallet V1, a smart wallet adds the 
single `SpendPermissionManager` contract as an owner of their account, and can then use this gatekeeper to authorize 
third-party spenders to spend from their account within their specified parameters. In addition to the spender, 
spend permissions specify the start and end times that bound a permissionâ€™s validity, as well as an allowance and a 
recurring period duration, allowing the spender to spend up to this allowance per-period. Users can revoke existing 
permissions at any time.
