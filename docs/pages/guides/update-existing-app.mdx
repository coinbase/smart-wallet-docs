# Update an existing project

## Direct dependency 
Follow the [installation instructions](/sdk/install).

## Wagmi 
1. Upgrade wagmi to version `2.9.0` or higher. 
1. Pass `preference: 'smartWalletOnly'` to the `coinbaseWallet` connector. [Example](/guides/create-app/using-wagmi#4-update-the-wagmi-config-and-coinbasewallet-connector-to-use-basesepolia)
1. Prior to mainnet launch:
  - Smart Wallet will be available for use with Base Sepolia only.
  - Smart Wallet will only be available on the `keys.coinbase.com` popup if `preference: 'smartWalletOnly'` is used. 


## Transitive dependency
If your project or its dependencies are already using 
Coinbase Wallet SDK, just add the following to `package.json`.
```json
"resolutions": {
  "@coinbase/wallet-sdk": "npm:@coinbase/wallet-sdk@4.0.0-beta.14"
}
```
After doing so, remember to run `install` with your package manager, e.g. `pnpm install`. 
Then, rebuild your project, and when you click to connect Coinbase Wallet, you will see a new 
popup window with a Smart Wallet option. 

:::info
Note, if you are having trouble and are using `yarn` or `npm`, you may need to use [force resolutions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-force-resolutions).
We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/), when possible.
