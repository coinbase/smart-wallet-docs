# Quick Start 
You can try Smart Wallet on Base Sepolia in your app using the 
Coinbase Wallet SDK beta. 

If your project or its dependencies are already using 
Coinbase Walelt SDK beta, just add the following to `package.json`.
```json
"resolutions": {
  "@coinbase/wallet-sdk": "npm:@coinbase/wallet-sdk@4.0.0-beta.12"
}
```
After doing so, remember to run `install` with your package manager, e.g. `npm install`. 
Then, rebuild your project, and when you click to connect Coinbase Wallet, you will see a new 
popup window with a Smart Wallet option. 

Reach out to us in the `#smart-wallet` channel on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cdp/) if you have any questions.

See our [install documentation](/sdk/install) for more detailed instructions. If you're creating a new project,
