# Smart Wallet Launch-Ready Checklist 
## The Basics

:::steps

### Test your app with Smart Wallet
 
Test your app with Smart Wallet enabled. See [our guide](/guides/update-existing-app).

### Ensure Smart Wallet compatible Signature Validation
 
If your app does any offchain signature validation (such as Sign-In With Ethereum) or your smart contracts 
do any signature validation, ensure your app is [ERC-6492](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6492) compliant. 
See [our guide](/guides/signature-verification). 

### Magic Spend Compatible
Magic Spend enables users to get "just in time" transaction funding from their Coinbase account.
This is currently supported for ETH only on Base. 
To give users the best experience, apps should make use of the `auxiliaryFunds` capability 
and ensure they are not blocking actions based solely on onchain balance checks. See [our guide](/guides/magic-spend).

### Use SDK 4.0 or later
Ensure your app is using SDK version 4.0 ahead of mainnet launch. If you are using a wallet library, check
[Wallet Library Support](/wallet-library-support) to ensure day 1 readiness.

:::info
Ahead of mainnet release, we have released a 4.0 version of the Coinbase Wallet SDK. For now, 
this version still only supports connecting via the Coinbase Wallet Extension or mobile app, but 
switches to using a popup window rather than an in-app modal. At mainnet launch, this popup window
will begin showing a Smart Wallet connection option, as well. 
See our [documentation](/sdk/makeWeb3Provider#parameters) for configuration options.

## Bonus: Make the most of Smart Wallet!
:::steps
### Batch Transactions
Improve your app's UX by using batch transactions, allowing, for examples, 
approvals and swaps to happen in a single transaction. See [our guide](/guides/batch-transactions).
### Paymasters (sponsored transactions)
Smart Wallet is one of the first wallets to support app-defined paymasters. This enables sponsoring
certain transactions for your users, so they do not have to know or think about gas cost. 
See [our guide](/guides/paymasters).
