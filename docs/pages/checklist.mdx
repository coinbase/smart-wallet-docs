# Smart Wallet Launch-Ready Checklist 
## The Basics
::::steps
### Test your app using the beta SDK
 
Test your app with Smart Wallet enabled on using the Beta SDK. See [our guide](/guides/beta).

### Ensure Smart Wallet compatible Signature Validation
 
If your app is using Sign in with Ethereum or similar, ensure you are [ERC-6492](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6492) compliant. 
Viem's [verifyMessage](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/verifyMessage#verifymessage) makes this very simple. 

If your smart contracts do any signature validation, ensure they follow [ERC-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271)
when the account is not an EOA.    

### Use SDK 4.0 or later
Your production app, or its wallet provider, should be using Coinbase Wallet SDK version 4.0 or later.
See Release Plan for more details.

### Magic Spend Compatible
Magic Spend enables users to get "just in time" transaction funding from their Coinbase account.
This is currently supported for ETH only on Base. 
To give users the best experience, apps should make use of the auxiliaryFunds capability, 
documented [here](#TODO /features/magic-spend) and ensure they are not blocking actions based solely on onchain balance checks.
