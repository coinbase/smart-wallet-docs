## Passkeys

<Callout type="info">
  It's crucial to understand how passkeys work and how they are managed by the passkey provider (eg: Apple, Google, Microsoft) before using them. If a user loses access to their passkey, they will not be able to access their smart wallet.
</Callout>

### Overview
Smart Wallet uses passkeys as the primary authentication method for both wallet access and transaction signing, replacing traditional private keys with a more secure and user-friendly solution.

There is no way for developers to configure passkey options. This page is focused on how passkeys work for users.

What is it used for?
- Required for wallet sign-in and transaction approval
- Used for adding additional passkeys and recovery
- Managed by your passkey provider (eg: Apple, Google, Microsoft)
- Supports cross-device access through provider sync

### Adding Passkeys
- New passkeys can be added using recovery keys
- Multiple passkeys can be added to a Smart Wallet
- Adding a passkey requires a transaction on each chain
- Previous passkeys are not automatically removed

### Removing Passkeys

<Callout type="warning">
  Removing keys is currently not supported in keys.coinbase.com.
</Callout>

### Considerations
When using passkeys, consider checking with your provider about:
- Backup and sync capabilities across devices
- Recovery procedures and options
- Device and operating system compatibility
- Security and privacy practices

### Platform Support and Resources
Passkeys work with any platform that supports the WebAuthn standard, allowing for wide compatibility across different devices and browsers. While many providers offer passkey support, here are documentation links for some common ones:
