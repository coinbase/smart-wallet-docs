## Details

### Addresses across Networks
Users have the same Smart Wallet address across supported networks.

### Deployment
- Smart Wallets are deployed using the "counterfactual deployment" pattern
- The wallet contract is deployed on first transaction
- Same address is reserved across all chains through CREATE2
- Deployment costs are included in the first transaction

### `initCode`
- `initCode` determines the wallet's address
- Contains factory address and initialization parameters
- Ensures consistent address across all chains
- Used by bundlers to deploy the wallet if needed

### tx.origin Behavior
- `tx.origin` will be the bundler EOA address, not the Smart Wallet address
- Consider this when integrating with existing contracts
