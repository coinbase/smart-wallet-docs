# Networks

## Mainnet Networks
- Base
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Zora 
- Polygon 
- BNB
- Avalanche
- Ethereum mainnet ([not recommended due to costs](/faq/why-does-it-cost-more-on-ethereum-l1))

## Testnet Networks
- Sepolia 
- Base Sepolia
- Optimism Sepolia

## Details

### Addresses across Networks
Users have the same Smart Wallet address across supported networks.

### Deployment
- Smart Wallets are deployed using the "counterfactual deployment" pattern
- The wallet contract is deployed on first transaction
- Same address is reserved across all chains through CREATE2
- Deployment costs are included in the first transaction

### `initCode`
- `initCode` determines the wallet's address
- Contains factory address and initialization parameters
- Ensures consistent address across all chains
- Used by bundlers to deploy the wallet if needed

### tx.origin Behavior
- `tx.origin` will be the bundler EOA address, not the Smart Wallet address
- Consider this when integrating with existing contracts

## Adding Network Support

To add a network, it will require the Smart Wallet team to prioritize it.

For a network to be supported, it needs:

- [Safe Singleton Factory](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-singleton-factory?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-get-the-singleton-deployed-to-your-network) (CREATE2 deployer) deployed at `0x914d7Fec6aaC8cd542e72Bca78B30650d45643d7`
- ERC-4337 Entrypoint v0.6 deployed at `0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789` 
- Smart Wallet Factory deployed at `0x0BA5ED0c6AA8c49038F819E587E2633c4A9F428a`
- ERC-4337 bundler meeting Coinbase's standards (availability, latency, security)
- Integration work from the Smart Wallet team
